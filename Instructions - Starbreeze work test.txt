Starbreeze Work Test -- Gameplay Programmer
============================================

The Task
--------

The task is to create Whakman, a simple Pacman like game using object oriented C++ and the supplied SBZWhakman library.
You can choose to do a straight up Pacman clone or a Pacman game with some kind of twist.
Choose whatever is more interesting to you. To help you get started, take a look at example.cpp.

Submit the finished code to us, together with a short note.
In the note you should tell us what we should look for in your submission,
what you are the most proud of in the implementation and what you wanted to have done better.
